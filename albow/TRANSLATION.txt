TRANSLATION FILE FORMAT DOCUMENTATION

These files work by mapping original english strings(o##) to the new translated
strings(t##).
As long as the numbers match, it will translate the specified english string to
the new language.
Any text formatting is preserved, so new lines, tabs, spaces, brackets, quotes
and other special characters can be used.

The white space (' ') after each tag, and 2 digit numbers are mandatory.
The file must also be encoded in UTF-8 or it won't work. Most editors should
support this. This is also mandatory, or you can experience weird aspect in the
program.

Syntax example:

o0 This is the first entry.
t0 Ceci est la première entrée.
o1 Here is the second one.
You can see it is splitted on two lines.
t1 Voici la deuxième.
Vous pouvez constater qu'elle est sur deux lignes.

The 'o##' markers on the begining of a line marks the original string;
the 't##', the translations.
Strings can be splited on several lines and contain any sort of
characters (thus, be aware of unicode).

Files are named according to their language name, e.g. fr_FR.trn for
french.
The extension .trn is an arbitrary convention, but must be respected to load
the files.

As convention, english is considered as the default language, and the
file en_EN.trn would never be present.

If you have issues with this, you can report on the site you have downloaded
the program.
Just open an 'issue' topic and let be the more precise you can. Joining .log
files and screenshots will be use full!
